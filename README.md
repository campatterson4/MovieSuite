# MovieSuite

MovieSuite is a website that will show you still shots from movies that may pique your interest. Upon hover, the name and summary of the movie will be
available for you to scan over which will help you decide if that is your type of movie or not. To make this site, I utilized CSS Grid to give the 
movie photos a nice masonry layout and JavaScript Scroll Reveal for a clean animation upon loading the page. These movies are all my personal favorites 
and you will not be dissapointed with them! 

Thank you for reading.
